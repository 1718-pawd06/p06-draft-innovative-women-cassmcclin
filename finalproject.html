					<b>Alice Paul</b> was born in New Jersey and attended Swarthmore College 
					before living in England and pushing for women's voting rights. She

					movement. 
				</p>
				
				<br />
				
				<p>
					Paul began her full-time suffrage career in 1912 and joined the 
					National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). There, she 
					gathered a group of young women who were willing to depart from the
					association's conservative tactics. The group of women officially 
					broke away from NAWSA in 1914, and in 1916, she founded the National 
					Women's Party (NWP) Going against public demand, Paul and the NWP 
					continued to picket the White House and Congress after the United 
					States entered World War I.
