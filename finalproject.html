				<img src="download-3.jpg" alt="Alice Paul Portrait" id="img1">
				
				<p>
					<b>Alice Paul</b> was born in New Jersey and attended Swarthmore College 
					before living in England and pushing for women's voting rights. She 
					returned to America in 1910 and became a leader in the suffragist 
					movement. 
					
					Paul began her full-time suffrage career in 1912 and joined the 
					National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). There, she 
					gathered a group of young women who were willing to depart from the
					association's conservative tactics. The group of women officially 
					broke away from NAWSA in 1914, and in 1916, she founded the National 
					Women's Party (NWP) Going against public demand, Paul and the NWP 
					continued to picket the White House and Congress after the United 
					States entered World War I. Paul and some of the other "Silent Sentenials" 
					were arrested under the charge of "obstructing traffic" even though they 
					were using their Constitutional right to peacefully protest on the 
					streets.

				<p>
					Just because women finally had the right to vote doesn't mean Alice 
					Paul was planning on stopping her campaign for women anytime soon.
					She earned a law degree from Washington College and a master's and 
					doctorate's degrees from American University. She continued to fight for 
					an Equal Rights Amendment up until she died, 50 years later. It was 
					finally passed by Congress in 1972 but never ratified by enough states. 
					Alice Paul died 5 years later of a stroke.
